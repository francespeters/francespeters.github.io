                    CourseConnect is a mobile application designed to foster a greater sense of belonging among students by helping them connect with peers in their classes. Through an iterative design process—beginning with background research and user interviews and evolving through ideation, paper prototypes, usability testing, wireframes, and both low- and high-fidelity prototypes—my team and I developed a solution that addresses the common challenge of turning classroom familiarity into real connections. Unlike platforms like Canvas or Piazza, CourseConnect is built specifically to support in-class social interaction. Students can join their Northeastern course sections, view classmate profiles, participate in class forums, create and join study groups, message others directly, and customize their profiles based on interests, major, and year. The app bridges the gap between simply recognizing someone in class and actually getting to know them—mitigating the initial awkwardness of reaching out, and turning academic spaces into opportunities for meaningful connection.                </p>
