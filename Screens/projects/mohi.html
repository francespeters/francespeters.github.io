                <p>
                    This project was the final capstone for my User Experience and Design Program in Seattle, WA. 
                    The program provided a foundation in Human-Computer Interaction and industry-standard design practices 
                    while connecting students with real-world sponsors seeking design improvements.
            
                    Over six weeks, I led my team in an evidence-based, user-centered design process, resulting in a 
                    functional prototype that represented our sponsor’s needs.

            <h3 class="overview-title"> Competitor Research</h3>
            <div class="overview">  
                <p>The design process started with investigating exisiting implementations of interactive museum maps and navigation tools. 
                    We analyzed both digital and physical solutions, identifying common pain points such as information overload, 
                    lack of interactivity, and poor accessibility. This research informed our design decisions, 
                    ensuring that our solution would address real user needs while standing out in the museum space.</p>

                <p> <strong>1. Legit Project: Legit Budapest Visitor Center</strong> <br>
                    <br>
                    Background: The Legit Budapest Visitor center acts as a starting point for visitors in Budapest. It features a highly detailed, 3D-printed model of Budapest combined with numerous handheld tablets that allow users to view different information regarding landmarks in the city by selecting different pins. 
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><strong>Strengths</strong> </p></li>
                        <li><p>- Centerpoint: The model itself is a tourist destination drawing people in to learn more about the city due to its detail and size. </p></li>
                        <li><p>- Interactive: The tablet allows users to interact with the physical model using an online interface
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>- Personalization: Allows for personalization of the existing map regarding what a user wants to learn more about.</p></li>
                        <li><p>- Free of Charge: The users do not have to pay to view the map or use the tablets.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p><strong>Weaknesses</strong> </p></li>
                        <li><p>- Less Accessibility: Requires the user to possess a higher skill set when navigating the tablet interface, for example, the tablet must calibrate in order to properly represent and translate the 3D-model. </p></li>
                        <li><p>- Implementation requires a high budget: The model itself was entirely 3D-printed requiring many resources making this design challenging to recreate
                        </p></li>

            <div class="overview">  
                <p>The design process started with interviewing 5 museum goers to better understand the 
                    current limitations of the museum’s static map design and identify opportunities for improvement.

                    <li><i> "I think [the interactive map] should be more prominent. When I walk in as a visitor, to me it's just a gray/black box. You don’t really notice it until you walk up to it.”</i></li>

            <div class="overview">  
                <p>Our team brainstormed solutions utilizing common design practices such as storyboarding, user flow mapping, and quick wireframes. We started to refine our design with low-fidelity prototypes. </p>
