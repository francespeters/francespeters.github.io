            <div class="overview">
                
                <p>
                    This project was the final capstone for my User Experience and Design Program in Seattle, WA. The program provided a foundation in Human-Computer Interaction and industry-standard design practices while connecting students with real-world sponsors seeking design improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My team of four collaborated with the Museum of History & Industry (MOHAI) in Seattle to address challenges with their museum exhibit navigation. The museum sought a more cohesive way to integrate their existing static maps into a user-friendly interface.

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Over six weeks, I led my team in an evidence-based, user-centered design process, resulting in a functional prototype that represented our sponsor’s needs.
                </p>

            </div>

            <h3 class="overview-title"> User Research</h3>
            <div class="overview">  
                <p>The design process started with interviewing 5 museum goers to better understand the current limitations of the museum’s static map design and identify opportunities for improvement.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p></p>

            <h3 class="overview-title">Ideation & Lo-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
            <div class="overview">  
                <p>Our team brainstormed solutions utilizing common design practices such as storyboarding, user flow mapping, and quick wireframes. We started to refine our design with low-fidelity prototypes. </p>
            </div>
            <p></p>

            <h3 class="overview-title">High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
            <div class="overview">  
                <p>
                    Our high-fidelity prototype was designed using Figma. To integrate preexisting maps from the museum Adobe Photoshop was used to edit and adapt the maps while preserving key information.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="overview-title">Usability Testing</h3>
            <div class="overview">  
                <p>We conducted four usability tests to evaluate our design, identify weaknesses, and establish goals for future iterations. </p>
