                     Petrichor is a brand that encapsulates the essence of nature's rejuvenation through its line of eco-friendly products. The name "Petrichor" refers to the pleasant, earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil, symbolizing renewal and freshness. This brand is dedicated to creating sustainable, environmentally conscious water beverages that not only enhance everyday living but also promote a deeper connection with the natural world. From biodegradable packaging to ethically sourced ingredients, Petrichor aims to inspire consumers to embrace a lifestyle that values and protects the environment.

                    The inital idea stemmed from the word "petrichor" and from there I built a water brand that ecoed the serinity and natural essence of this word. Every design choice was intentional, from the waterdrop shape of the bottle to its glass material. I chose to let the features of the typeface do the talking for the logo. The sparkling water variation was sigaled through the sun rays around the word sparkling, meant to convey the effect of sun reflecting off of water. </p>

                    The brand touchpoints I designed for Petrichor include the logo, packaging, labels, and advertisements. Each touchpoint was crafted to reflect the brand's commitment to sustainability and its connection to nature.
