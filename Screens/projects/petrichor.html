                <div class="overview">
                    <p>
                     This was a project I worked on for my Identity and Brand Design course. Our task was to observe beverages in the 
                     world and then build our own brand. I found it interesting how water, something that is a daily necessity, 
                     could come in so many different forms with their own individal brand tones and personality. I took inspriation from water
                     brands like Voss, but wanted to create a brand that felt more connected to nature and the environment. 
                     I wanted to create a brand that not only provided a refreshing beverage but also inspired consumers to embrace a lifestyle that values and protects the environment.

                     Petrichor is a brand that embodies the idea of eco-friendly products as it is continuing the rain cycle by filtering and our rainwater and making it safe to drink. The name "Petrichor" refers to the pleasant, earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil, symbolizing renewal and freshness. 
                     My goal was to create brand was dedicated to creating sustainable, environmentally conscious water 
                     beverages that not only provide everyday refreshment but also promote a deeper connection with the natural world. 
                     In order to enjoy the smell of petrichor, you have to be outside in nature, and that is the feeling I wanted to evoke with this brand.
                     From glass, reusable packaging to ethically sourced ingredients, Petrichor aims to inspire consumers to embrace a lifestyle that values and protects the environment.

                                          <br/>
                    One intial limitation with this idea is that it is not possible... let me explain. Rainwater is not inherently safe to drink as it can collect pollutants from the atmosphere and surfaces it comes into contact with. 
                    Therefore, to make rainwater safe for consumption, it must undergo proper filtration and purification processes
                    Currently, the CDC does not recommend drinking rainwater without treatment due to potential health risks. However, with the right technology and processes in place, 
                    someday it will be possible to create a safe and sustainable water brand that utilizes rainwater as its source.

                    The inital idea stemmed from the word "petrichor" and from there I built a water brand that ecoed the serinity and natural essence of this word. Every design choice was intentional, from the waterdrop shape of the bottle to its glass material. I chose to let the features of the typeface do the talking for the logo. The sparkling water variation was sigaled through the sun rays around the word sparkling, meant to convey the effect of sun reflecting off of water. </p>

                    The brand touchpoints I designed for Petrichor include the logo, packaging, 
                    labels, and advertisements. Each touchpoint was crafted to reflect the 
                    brand's commitment to sustainability and its connection to nature.

                                          <br/>
                    The logo features a minimalistic design, letting the Adobe Monarcha typeface do the talking. 
                    The typeface appears rythmic, like rain, and feels even a bit poetic. 
                    The packaging is made from glass, a sustainable material that can be reused and recycled while the
                    shape istdelf resembles a water droplet, reinforcing the brand's connection to water and nature. 
                    The labels are designed to be simple, reflecting the purity of the product, 
                    while also incorporating elements like the definitions of "petrichor". 
                    The carbonated water variation is sigaled through the sun rays around the word sparkling, meant to convey the effect of sun reflecting off of water.
